Code book for the dataset "clean.txt"
course: Getting and Cleaning Data
session: 015, June 1st 2015
Course project submission
Student: Guillaume Bourgault
Each observation is identified by two variables:
	-"subjectId": a number between 1 and 30
	-"activity": an activity name taken from the following possibilities:
		-LAYING
		-SITTING
		-STANDING
		-WALKING
		-WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		-WALKING_UPSTAIRS
The other variables names give away their origin.  
Elements of the variable names are separated by "-".  
The first element is either "mean" or "standard_dev".  
The second element is the variable measured:
	-BodyAcc
	-GravityAcc
	-BodyAccJerk
	-etc.
The third element tells if the the signals are reported before or after the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
	-time_domain (before FFT)
	-Fourier_domain (after FFT)
The variable name might contain a fourth element, indicating the direction X, Y or Z measured by the signal.  
The data shown in the dataset is the average of every signal measured during each activity for each subject.
